### Introduction

I have participated in a "Bydgoski Hackaton" in 20.11.2020 where my team earned honourable mention. Our project was a website dedicated 
to learning physical education in schools online. Website provides numerous features that allow 
PE teachers to create and assign tasks for their students and monitor their results.

It's MatheoK cut. App uses Firebase.
Original version uses .NET & MongoDB.
